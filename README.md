## Purpose:
picampirpush takes, as the name suggests, photos after having detected a Motion at the PIR-Sensor. Then 16 pictures are taken and assembled. Finally these pictures are sent via a Pushbullet account to your mobile.
## Requirements:
blub
## ToDo:
Upload pictures to own server instead of pushbullet and send only the imagelink.
